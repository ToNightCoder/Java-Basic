/*    Java Class Methods
You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:

Example
Create a method named myMethod() in Main:

Inside main, call myMethod():*/
public class ClassMethods {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
    
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}
